## What is ArchiveBox?

ArchiveBox is a **self-hosted app that lets you preserve content from websites in a variety of formats.** Without active preservation effort, everything on the internet eventually disappears or degrades.

We aim to make your data immediately useful, and kept in formats that other programs can read directly. As output, we save standard HTML, PNG, PDF, TXT, JSON, WARC, SQLite, all guaranteed to be readable for decades to come. ArchiveBox also has a CLI, REST API, and webhooks so you can set up integrations with other services.

ArchiveBox is an open source tool that lets organizations & individuals archive both public & private web content while retaining control over their data. It can be used to save copies of bookmarks, preserve evidence for legal cases, backup photos from FB/Insta/Flickr or media from YT/Soundcloud/etc., save research papers, and more.

## What Does ArchiveBox Save?

For each web page you archive, ArchiveBox creates a snapshot and preserves its content in multiple redundant formats:

- **HTML & DOM**: Original HTML+CSS+JS, SingleFile snapshot, DOM dump
- **Visual**: Screenshots (PNG), PDF printouts
- **Metadata**: Title, favicon, headers, response data
- **Media**: Audio/video files via yt-dlp, including subtitles and metadata
- **Articles**: Extracted article text using Readability & Mercury
- **Source Code**: Git repository clones from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **Archives**: WARC files via wget, Archive.org permalinks
- **And more**: See [Output Formats](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki#output-formats) for the full list

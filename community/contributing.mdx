# Contributing to ArchiveBox

All contributions to ArchiveBox are welcomed! We appreciate your help in making this project better.

## Getting Started

### Confirm Your Idea Fits

1. Check our [Roadmap](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Roadmap) to confirm your desired features fit into our bigger project goals
2. Open an issue with your planned implementation to discuss
3. Check in before starting development to make sure your work won't conflict with or duplicate existing work

### Find Something to Work On

For low hanging fruit and easy first tickets, see:

- [Issues labeled "help wanted"](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- [Issues labeled "good first ticket"](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+ticket%22)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (3.13 recommended)
- uv package manager
- A non-root user for running tests (e.g., `testuser`)

### Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the main code repo (with submodules)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox
cd ArchiveBox
git checkout dev  # or the branch you want to test
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install dependencies (always use uv, never pip directly)
uv sync --dev --all-extras

# Install ArchiveBox runtime dependencies
mkdir -p data && cd data
archivebox install  # or 'archivebox setup' on older versions
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
# Development server with autoreloading (no bg workers)
archivebox manage runserver --debug --reload 0.0.0.0:8000

# Production server (with bg workers but no autoreloading)
archivebox server 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build development Docker image
./bin/build_docker.sh dev

# Initialize with Docker
docker run -it -v $PWD/data:/data archivebox/archivebox:dev init --setup

# Run development server
docker run -it -v $PWD/data:/data -v $PWD/archivebox:/app/archivebox \
  -p 8000:8000 archivebox/archivebox:dev manage runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --debug --reload
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming for grep-ability and logical grouping:

- **Group related functions with common prefixes**: `fs_migrate()`, `fs_migration_needed()`
- **Use `_` prefix for private helpers**: `_log_error()`, `_fs_next_version()`
- **All logging methods must start with `log_` or `_log`**

### Minimize Unique Names

Reuse existing field names and data structures to keep the codebase predictable:

```python
# GOOD: Reuse the same field name
class Binary(models.Model):
    overrides = models.JSONField(default=dict)

# BAD: Inventing new names
class Binary(models.Model):
    custom_bin_cmds = models.JSONField(default=dict)  # ❌
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (as non-root user)
sudo -u testuser bash -c 'source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest archivebox/tests/ -v'

# Run specific test file
pytest archivebox/tests/test_migrations_08_to_09.py -v

# Run single test
pytest archivebox/tests/test_migrations_fresh.py::TestFreshInstall::test_init_creates_database -xvs
```

### Test Writing Standards

- **NO MOCKS**: Tests must exercise real code paths with real databases
- **NO SKIPS**: Never use `@skip` or `pytest.mark.skip` - fix the test or code instead
- **Strict Assertions**: Use exact counts (`==`) not loose bounds (`>=`)

### Linting

```bash
./bin/lint.sh  # Uses flake8, mypy, ruff
./bin/test.sh  # Uses pytest
```

## Making Changes

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Generate migrations after changes to models.py
cd archivebox/
./manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations to test database
cd data/
archivebox init
```

### Adding a New Extractor

Extractors are external binaries or scripts that archive content. See examples:

- [Issue #399](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/399) + [PR #403](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/pull/403) - Adding SingleFile extractor
- Check [`archivebox/extractors/`](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/tree/dev/archivebox/extractors) for existing extractors

## Submitting Changes

1. **Make your changes** and test thoroughly
2. **Commit with clear messages** describing the why, not just the what
3. **Push to your fork** and submit a Pull Request
4. **Wait for review feedback** and be patient - we all have day jobs!
5. **Don't abandon your PR** - ping [@theSquashSH](https://twitter.com/thesquashSH) if you need faster response

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting

## Code Coverage

We track code coverage to find dead code and improve test quality:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=archivebox --cov-report=term archivebox/tests/

# Generate coverage report
coverage combine
coverage report --show-missing

# View HTML report
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

# Web Archiving Ecosystem

ArchiveBox is part of a larger ecosystem of web archiving tools, organizations, and communities working to preserve internet content.

## Our Community Wiki

Our [Community Wiki](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community) strives to be a comprehensive index of the web archiving industry:

- **[Web Archiving Software](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#web-archiving-projects)** - List of ArchiveBox alternatives and open source projects in the internet archiving space
- **[Awesome-Web-Archiving Lists](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#the-master-lists)** - Community-maintained indexes like `iipc/awesome-web-archiving`
- **[Reading List](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#reading-list)** - Articles, posts, and blogs relevant to web archiving
- **[Communities](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Web-Archiving-Community#communities)** - Active internet archiving communities and initiatives

## Related Projects

### Centralized Public Archives

**Archive.org (Internet Archive)**

The largest public web archive, providing free access to billions of archived web pages through the Wayback Machine. ArchiveBox can automatically save URLs to Archive.org for redundancy (configurable with `SAVE_ARCHIVEDOTORG`).

- Website: https://archive.org
- Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org

### Self-Hosted Archiving Alternatives

**ArchiveWeb.page & ReplayWeb.page**

For better fidelity with complex interactive pages, heavy JS, streams, and API requests:

- https://archiveweb.page
- https://replayweb.page

**Bookmark Management with Archiving**

If you want more bookmark categorization and note-taking features:

- **[Memex](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex)** - Full-text search for browsing history and bookmarks
- **[Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder)** - Self-hosted bookmark manager
- **[LinkWarden](https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden)** - Collaborative bookmark manager
- **[Archivy](https://archivy.github.io/)** - Knowledge base with archiving
- **[LinkAce](https://www.linkace.org/)** - Bookmark archive manager

**Advanced Crawling Tools**

For more advanced recursive spider/crawling ability beyond `--depth=1`:

- **[Browsertrix](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-crawler)** - High-fidelity browser-based crawler
- **[Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon)** - Fast web crawler
- **[Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)** - Python web scraping framework

You can pipe URLs from these tools into ArchiveBox for archiving.

### ArchiveBox Integrations

**Browser Extensions**

- **[ArchiveBox Browser Extension](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-browser-extension)** - Official extension for Chrome/Firefox providing realtime archiving
- **[ArchiveBox Exporter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/habonpimjphpdnmcfkaockjnffodikoj)** - Chrome Web Store version

**Proxy Archiving**

- **[archivebox-proxy](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/archivebox-proxy)** - Archive all traffic through a MITM proxy using ArchiveBox

**Desktop Apps**

- **[Electron ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/electron-archivebox)** - Desktop application wrapper (alpha)

## What Makes ArchiveBox Unique

ArchiveBox gained momentum in the internet archiving industry because it uniquely combines three things:

1. **Distributed**: Users own their data instead of entrusting it to one big central provider
2. **Future-proof**: Saving in multiple formats and extracting raw TXT, PNG, PDF, MP4, etc. files
3. **Extensible**: Powerful APIs, flexible storage, and a big community adding new extractors regularly

### vs. Centralized Public Archives

Not all content is suitable for centralized, publicly accessible platforms. Archive.org doesn't archive content behind login walls. ArchiveBox fills this gap by:

- Enabling individual archiving of private/authenticated content
- Supporting decentralized archiving less susceptible to censorship or disasters
- Allowing users to archive much larger portions of the internet than centralized services can handle

### vs. Other Self-Hosted Tools

ArchiveBox differentiates itself through:

- Comprehensive CLI interface for power users
- Web UI that works independently or with the CLI
- Simple on-disk data format usable without running ArchiveBox
- Multiple output formats for long-term durability
- Active development and community support

## Industry Organizations

**International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)**

A global community of organizations dedicated to preserving internet content for future generations.

- Website: https://netpreserve.org/

**Archive Team**

A loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers, and loudmouths dedicated to saving digital history.

- Website: https://wiki.archiveteam.org/

## Alternative Frontends

When archiving sites that block bots, you can rewrite URLs to use alternative frontends:

- `reddit.com/some/url` → `teddit.net/some/url`
- See: https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends

This helps work around bot blocking while preserving content ethically.

## Join the Movement

Web archiving is a collective effort to preserve digital history. Whether you're:

- A researcher preserving academic resources
- A journalist saving cited sources
- An individual backing up personal bookmarks
- An organization maintaining institutional knowledge

...you're part of the solution to link rot and digital deterioration.

Start archiving today and help preserve the internet for future generations!
